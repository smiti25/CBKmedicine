Literature Survey: - 
 
• Existing System: - 
The existing medical Booking Store system is time consuming and requires more man power to function well.
Secondly the scope of offline medical store is limited to local area and is available for fixed timing. 
All the data management involving product availability, searching, billing and other report generation are done manually which indeed are very time consuming. 
 																			
• Proposed System: -  
The main advantage of the proposed the system is the user can easily find out the availability of particular medicine through own devices. 
This system also shows the nearest pharmaceutical shops on their devices. This system can be divided into various sections. 
In this project user can view the medicines online and give the orders any time. Admin can add the products and view the order list. 
The proposed medical Booking Store system will completely Revolutionize the industry. 
Searching of products, order placing, billing and product stock can be maintained by a single click.
